# On The Way Podcast Platform

## Project overview
"On The Way" is a podcast platform developed for the city of Yverdon as part of the integration project at the Haute Ecole d'Ing√©nierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud, media engineering track. The platform facilitates communication between the city and its residents through multimedia content.

## Key features

### Admin Part
Administrators from the city have access to a variety of tools designed to manage and distribute podcast content effectively:
- **Season management:** Create and manage seasons with comprehensive details including title, description, characters involved, locations, related documents, and thematic images.
- **Episode publishing:** Episodes are published and managed through integration with the Podbean API, allowing seamless podcast distribution.
- **User management:** Admins can add users, initiate password setups via email, and manage roles within the platform.
- **Analytics dashboard:** View detailed statistics on episode listens and website visits to gauge audience engagement.
- **Message Center:** Review and respond to messages from users, categorized by queries such as comments, questions, or partnership requests.

### User Part
The public interface allows users to:
- **Explore content:** View available podcast series and episodes.
- **Media playback:** Listen to episodes directly on the platform.
- **EEngagement:** Contact the creators with feedback or questions through an integrated messaging system.

## Technical architecture

### Database integration
The platform utilizes Vercel for hosting and directly interacts with a PostgreSQL database configured through Vercel environment variables. This setup ensures streamlined deployment and management processes, aligning with modern cloud architecture practices.

### Data models
The application employs Prisma as its ORM, facilitating effective database management with the following models:
- **User:** Manages user information, including authentication tokens and admin roles.
- **Message:** Stores messages from users with categories for filtering and organization.
- **ApiToken:** Handles API token generation and expiration for secure access.
- **Collection:** Represents a collection of podcast series, each with unique attributes like description and associated media.
